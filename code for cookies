You can create a cookie in PHP with the specified conditions using the setcookie() function. To create a cookie named "user" with the value "Uday" and an expiration time of 15 hours, you can use the following PHP program:

php
<?php
// Define the cookie name and value
$cookieName = "user";
$cookieValue = "Uday";

// Calculate the expiration time (15 hours from the current time)
$expirationTime = time() + (15 * 3600); // 1 hour = 3600 seconds

// Create the cookie
setcookie($cookieName, $cookieValue, $expirationTime);

// Display a message to indicate that the cookie has been set
echo "Cookie '$cookieName' has been set with the value '$cookieValue' and will expire in 15 hours.";
?>


In this program:

1. We define the cookie name as "user" and the value as "Uday."

2. We calculate the expiration time by adding 15 hours (in seconds) to the current timestamp, using the time() function.

3. We use the setcookie() function to create the cookie with the specified name, value, and expiration time.

4. Finally, we display a message to confirm that the cookie has been set with the specified conditions.

This PHP program will create a cookie named "user" with the value "Uday," and it will expire after 15 hours from the time it was set.
